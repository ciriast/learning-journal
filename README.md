# learning-journal
This is my personal learning journal. I document everything I learn when I'm not coding â€” reading books, exploring tools, setting up environments, or digging into foundational concepts.

## How I use it
- Every dy I do something new, I add an entry to the current month's file.
- If a topic grows too much, I move it into the `topics/` folder.
- I can search across files to track my progress or revisit old ideas.
