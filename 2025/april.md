I continue working in the snake game, I have in mind to read the current book also, let's see if I can achieve that goal for today.

Today I won't be doing a lot of things, yesterday was hard at work, so I need to rest and prepare myself for today.
I'm in love with tmux, honesty, my env now just feel right.
